## What is Sparrow Wallet?

Sparrow is a desktop only bitcoin wallet, [available](https://www.sparrowwallet.com/download/) on all major platforms that provides a fantastic alternative to Electrum or [Specter](/specter). Sparrow provides huge amounts of detail to the user relating to their UTXO's, transactions and balances, but does so in a very user friendly manner.

## Features

Sparrow Wallet comes with everything you'd expect from a desktop based wallet, and much more...

- Own node backing (via Electrum server or Bitcoin Core)
- Ability to connect to pre selected public Electrum servers for those without their own node
- Ability to broadcast through Tor network using an external node
- Wallet imports (including Electrum)
- All major hardware wallet support (including air gapped devices)
- Coin selection and labelling
- Multi-Sig
- PSBT
- Watch only wallets
- Custom derivation paths


## Download and verify Sparrow Wallet


* [Download](https://www.sparrowwallet.com/download/) Sparrow Wallet for your chosen operating system
* Download the `Manifest.txt` + `Manifest.asc` files

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp2.png" class=responsive width="350" height="350" maxheight="400" />
</p>


* Import Craig Raw's public key 

`curl https://keybase.io/craigraw/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import`


<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp1.png" class=responsive width="600" height="110" maxheight="400" />
</p>

* Open your downloads folder in the terminal and run `gpg --verify sparrow-1.4.1-manifest.txt.asc`

* Look for 'Good signature from "Craig Raw <craigraw@gmail.com>". This confirms the file came from the entity in control of Craig Raw's private GPG key

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp3.png" class=responsive width="500" height="125" maxheight="400" />
</p>

* Run `sha256sum sparrow_1.4.1-1_amd64.deb`

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp4.png" class=responsive width="600" height="70" maxheight="400" />
</p>

* Open the `Manifest.txt` file you downloaded earlier and check that the hash provided matches the one shown in your terminal window. A match confirms the contents of the file you downloaded are an exact match to the one built by Craig when he signed these files

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp5.png" class=responsive width="600" height="90" maxheight="400" />
</p>

If you're using Windows, there's a guide for [installation and verification of Sparrow here](https://www.athena-alpha.com/install-sparrow-wallet-on-windows/).

<br/>

## Initial Set up

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp7.png" class=responsive width="400" height="300" maxheight="400" />
</p>

Sparrow Wallet offers users 3 ways to get started, each with their own pro's and con's.


| Server Type                   | Trade-off              | Positives             |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| Pre selected public Electrum Server  | Not your own hardware and shares wallet information with the entity running the server   | Easiest way to get started |
| Private Bitcoin Core node  | Wallet imports can take a while and uses Bitcoin Core which stores it's wallets unencrypted   | Next easiest setup type (user can just download Bitcoin Core)
| Private Electrum Server  | Biggest barrier to entry   | Most private option + provides fastest wallet queries |

> The Public Electrum Server's provided have been selected due to their record of respecting users privacy. However, running your own is *always* be the best option.


After reading through the initial welcome screens, click 'Configure Server'. Sparrow will default to a public Electrum Server but for the purpose of the rest of this guide, we will be connecting to a private Electrum Server. Select that option from the menu at the top.

* Enter your Electrum Server onion address *(or local IP address)*
* Set the port to `50001`
* Toggle `Use SSL` off
* Specify optional Tor proxy and port *(if you don't know what this means, leave these boxes blank)*

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp89.png" class=responsive width="460" height="400" maxheight="500" />
</p>

* Click 'Test Connection'. After a brief wait you will see a successful connection notification.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp9.png" class=responsive width="460" height="200" maxheight="300" />
</p>

> If connection is unsuccessful try changing the top right box to `50002` and toggling `Use SSL` to on.

For those with an Umbrel node, you can follow this guide by [Athena Alpha](https://www.athena-alpha.com/connect-sparrow-wallet-to-umbrel/) that outlines how to connect Sparrow to your own Umbrel node using the Electrs app. They also have a guide showing how to [connect Sparrow to Bitcoin Core](https://www.athena-alpha.com/connect-sparrow-wallet-to-bitcoin-core/) as well.

## Importing your Coldcard
The following assumes that you have already initiated your Coldcard. If you have yet to do so, you can follow [this](/coldcard) guide.


* On your Coldcard go to `Advanced` > `Micro SD` > `Export Wallet` > `Generic JSON`.

This will make a copy of your wallet onto your SD card that is readable by Sparrow Wallet. You can find more detail on this [here](https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware/blob/master/docs/generic-wallet-export.md). Once complete put the SD card into your computer. 

* In Sparrow, go to `File`> `Import Wallet` > `Import File`.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp10.png" class=responsive width="350" height="350" maxheight="300" />
</p>

* Choose the `coldcard-export.json` on the SD card.
* Select the script type and press `Import`.

> P2PKH = 'Legacy' addresses starting with a `1`
> P2SH-P2WPKH = 'Segwit' compatibility addresses starting with a `3`
>P2WPKH = 'Native Segwit' addresses starting with `BC1`

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp11.png" class=responsive width="350" height="350" maxheight="300" />
</p>

* Choose a name for your wallet.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp12.png" class=responsive width="350" height="170" maxheight="300" />
</p>

* Give your wallet an optional password. This password is specific to Sparrow and has nothing to do with the underlying seed.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp13.png" class=responsive width="350" height="200" maxheight="300" />
</p>

* That's it! You should now see your home screen with your Cold Card transactions and balances. (This is a brand new empty wallet shown below).

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp14.png" class=responsive width="600" height="500" maxheight="300" />
</p>

<br/>

## Receive a transaction

* Go to the receive tab to view your first receive address. You can then share the address or QR code with whoever is sending you bitcoin.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp17.png" class=responsive width="600" height="500" maxheight="300" />
</p>

* You should always verify the recieve address on your Coldcard.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp16.png" class=responsive width="240" height="320" maxheight="300" />
</p>

<br/>

## Sending a transaction

> Using these steps the wallet will choose which UTXO's it spends for you.

* Go to the send tab
* Paste the address you are sending to
* Enter the amount and adjust your fee rate
* Press `Create transaction`

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/testtx.png" class=responsive width="663" height="494" maxheight="300" />
</p>


* The next screen provides an incredibly detailed breakdown for the more advanced user to fine tune so more technical details where required. For most users the default settings will be fine, click `Finalize transaction for signing`

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp19.png" class=responsive width="663" height="474" maxheight="300" />
</p>

* Click `Save PSBT` and select the SD card as the save location 

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp21.png" class=responsive width="663" height="474" maxheight="300" />
</p>

* Pass the SD card back to your Coldcard and click `Ready to Sign`
* Choose the file name of the `.psbt` file you just saved from Sparrow
* Review the transaction details and press `sign`
* The Coldcard will now save a `signed.psbt` file to the SD card


To broadcast the transaction...

- Load the SD card back into your computer
- In Sparrow press `Load PSBT`
- Choose the signed PSBT file on the SD card
- You can now have a final review of the details and broadcast the transaction to the network

<br/>

## Spending using specific UTXO(s)

1. Go to the `UTXO` tab
2. Select all of the UTXO's you want to use to create your transaction
3. Press `send selected`
4. Follow the steps outlined in the previous section

<br/>

## Creating a multisig wallet

As well as being fantastic at single sig support, it also excels at multisig! This section assumes that you have already initiated these devices, if you have not already done so, follow [these](/multisig/signers) steps.

Here is a brief run down of setting up a 2-of-3 quorum using Sparrow.

* Click `File` > `New Wallet`, give the wallet a name then click `Create new wallet`
* Change the `Policy Type` to `Multi Signature`
* Choose your cosigner setup (we are using 2-of-3 here)

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp22.png" class=responsive width="663" height="474" maxheight="300" />
</p>

<br/>

### Coldcard Import

* Ensure the SD card is inserted into the Coldcard then go to `Settings` > `Multisig Wallets` > `Export XPUB`
* The Coldcard will save a file that looks like `ccxp-8ff26349.json` to the SD card
* Pass the SD card back to your computer

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/coldcard00.png" class=responsive width="250" height="400" maxheight="300" />
</p>


* In Sparrow ensure Keystore 1 is selected and press Air Gapped Hardware Wallet
* Choose `Import File` next to `Coldcard Multisig` 


<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/recover4.png" class=responsive width="650" height="400" maxheight="300" />
</p>

### Cobo Vault Import

<img src="/assets/img/cobospecter.png" class=responsive width="350" height="400" maxheight="300" />
</p>

* Tap the three dots in the top right corner then `Show/Export XPUB`. This will bring up a QR on screen. 

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/cobospecter1.png" class=responsive width="350" height="400" maxheight="300" />
</p>


* In Sparrow, select `Keystore 2` > `Air Gapped Hardware Wallet` then `Scan` for the Cobo Vault Multisig option. This will open your computers camera, hold the device so that the QR code on the Cobo can be read

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/recover6.png" class=responsive width="650" height="400" maxheight="300" />
</p>


### Specter DIY Import

* In Specter DIY tap `Master Public Keys` > `Multisig`. The screen should then show a QR code

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sp24.png" class=responsive width="220" height="400" maxheight="300" />
</p>

* In Sparrow, select `Keystore 3` > `Air Gapped Hardware Wallet` then `Scan` for the Specter DIY Multisig option. This will open your computers camera, hold the device so that the QR code on the Specter DIY can be read

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/multisig2.png" class=responsive width="650" height="400" maxheight="300" />
</p>

* Click `Apply` then set an optional password to secure your wallet

<br/>

## Notifying signers

Now that the wallet is created, we need to notify each signer of the wallet creation.

### Notify Coldcard

* Press `Export` > `Export File` next to Coldcard Multisig
* Insert the Coldcard micro SD card into your computer and copy the generated `.txt` file onto it
* Remove the SD card and insert back into your Coldcard

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/multisig3.png" class=responsive width="500" height="160" maxheight="300" />
</p>

* Power on your Coldcard and enter your PIN. Go to `Settings` > `Multisig Wallets` > `Import from SD`. 

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/spec11.png" class=responsive width="200" height="250" maxheight="300" />
</p>

* There will only be one to choose from 

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/multisig5.png" class=responsive width="200" height="270" maxheight="300" />
</p>

* Check all details shown on the device match those shown in Specter and then confirm

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/spec13.png" class=responsive width="200" height="270" maxheight="300" />
</p>

### Notify Cobo

* Press `Export` > `Show` next to Cobo Vault Multisig
* On the Cobo open the menu then press `Multisig Wallet` > `Import Multisig`, then tap the QR scanner button in the top right

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/spec8.png" class=responsive width="700" height="400" maxheight="300" />
</p>

* Scan the QR code being displayed by Sparrow then check the public key information shown on the device matches those displayed in Sparrow

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/multisig7.png" class=responsive width="300" height="400" maxheight="300" />
</p>

### Notify Specter DIY

This is not currently supported in Sparrow. However it is sufficient to verify receive and change addresses on the other two signing devices.

<br/>

## Backup

Multisig backups are more complex than their single signature counterparts. You can read an in-depth look at this [here](/multisig/backup).

* In Sparrow click `Export` > `Export File` next to Sparrow
* If your wallet is not password protected, this will create a `.json` file that you can back up onto as many SD cards as you like
* If the wallet is password protected this will download a copy of your encrypted wallet file which you can open in Sparrow

> This file is a 'view only' into your multisig wallet. To spend you still need m-of-n signers or seed backups

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/multisig11.png" class=responsive width="400" height="400" maxheight="300" />
</p>

<br/>

## Verify Receive Addresses

You will have already noticed that Sparrow shows you your first receive address. It is now important to verify that receive address on our trusted signing devices. Not all signing devices facilitate this, which is the reason both Coldcard and Cobo were included into this guide.

### Sparrow

* Click into the receive tab and your first receive address will be shown

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/multisig14.png" class=responsive width="650" height="450" maxheight="300" />
</p>

### Coldcard

* Power on your Coldcard and enter your PIN. Press `Address Explorer`. scroll to the bottom and enter the number indicated to start
* Scroll to the bottom of the next page and choose your recently imported multisig wallet
* You will now have the option to save these to the SD card which could be useful if you plan on receiving often and wont have easy access to your devices
* Scroll down, you will see the fingerprint of each signer, after that you should see a partially hidden version of your first receive address. Check it matches the one shown by Sparrow

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/multisig12.png" class=responsive width="270" height="350" maxheight="300" />
</p>

### Cobo Vault

* Open the menu and press `Multisig Wallet` which will open the receive tab. Press the top address and check it matches the one shown in Sparrow


<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/multisig13.png" class=responsive width="300" height="400" maxheight="300" />
</p>

> All 3 match? Send a very small amount of sats to your verified address

<br/>

## Spending

* Create the transaction in the same way described earlier then press `Create Transaction`

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sparowmultisig1.png" class=responsive width="600" height="450" maxheight="400" />
</p>

* Review the transaction details then click `Finalize Transaction for Signing`

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sparrowmultisig2.png" class=responsive width="600" height="450" maxheight="400" />
</p>

### Sign with Coldcard

* Click `Save PSBT` and select the SD card as the save location
* Pass the SD card back to your Coldcard and click `Ready to Sign`
* Choose the file name of the `.psbt` file you just saved from Sparrow
* Review the transaction details and press `sign`
* The Coldcard will now save a `signed.psbt` file to the SD card
* Pass the SD card back to your computer
* In Sparrow, click `Load PSBT`, choose the `part.psbt` file

> We now have 1 of a required 2 signatures

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/sparrowmultisig3.png" class=responsive width="600" height="450" maxheight="400" />
</p>

### Sign with Cobo Vault

* In Sparrow, click `Show QR`
* On Cobo Vault, open your multisig wallet and press the QR scanner button
* Scan the QR code displayed by Specter with the device
* Review the transaction details, confirm and enter your password. The device will then show an animated QR code on screen
