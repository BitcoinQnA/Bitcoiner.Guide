This page is a collection of the tools I use to remain as in control of my data as my techincal skills allow. This list will evolve over time as new tools become available and/or my personal requirements change. Just like Bitcoin, the overwhelming majority of these tools are Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). If you use any of these tools, please consider contributing back to those FOSS teams in any way you can. Here are some ideas on how you can do that :-

* Using the product and providing feedback
* Testing beta releases
* Paying for 'premuim' options
* Telling others about the tool
* Providing education or guides
* Being a part of the community

> The best time to start regaining your sovereignty is today. Don't get overwhelmed, just start taking small steps!
