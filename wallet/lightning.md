Lightning native wallets aren't that different from a 'normal' bitcoin wallet, in fact some of the options below offer both, but come with a particular focus on Lightning functionality of small/fast payments. Some achieve on-chain interaction via the use of [submarine swaps](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/pay-bitcoin-mainnet-lightning-and-back-submarine-swaps-are-now-live) and others require users to connect to their own Bitcoin and/or Lightning node.

## Phoenix

[Phoenix](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) is another great starter wallet for users wanting to onboard with Lightning. Much like Breez, Phoenix seamlessly supports on-chain send/receive transactions via submarine swaps and also opens channels on demand for a small fee. These swaps result in a certain level of [trust](https://phoenix.acinq.co/faq#is-phoenix-trustless) in the entity running the swap service (Acinq) and users should also consider the privacy [tradeoffs](https://phoenix.acinq.co/faq#how-private-are-my-payments-on-phoenix) that come with this setup too.

## Zap

[Zap](https://zaphq.io/) has multiple [implementations](https://zaphq.io/download), all offering slightly different functionality. Both main release mobile offerings currently do not allow wallet creation and only offer remote Lightning node connection. However, the [testflight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/elC3EXAK) version on iOS does offer wallet creation functionality. There is a desktop application available on Windows, Mac OS and Linux that allow for remote node connectivity and wallet creation. All Zap offerings come with a simple user interface and support on and off chain transactions.
