A Bitcoin wallet is a just like your real wallet, it's a method of storing value. The main difference with a Bitcoin wallet is that it doesn't actually store bitcoin inside, bitcoins exist solely on the distributed ledger (blockchain). A bitcoin wallet stores the keys required sign the transactions that send bitcoin. When you sign a transaction with your wallet, you show proof that you have the right to spend those coins. This proof can be checked by anyone running a node which stops anyone cheating the system.

There goes a famous saying amongst Bitcoiners, ***'not your keys, not your coins'***. The phrase is aimed to drive home the fact that, if you are not the custodian of your wallet's private keys, you essentially have no bitcoin. A good example of this is buying bitcoin on an exchange and leaving it there. You may have a claim to x amount of bitcoin, but the exchange is actually in control of the private keys. What ***you*** actually have is an IOU that can be taken from you, for various reasons, at any moment. By taking control of your bitcoin in a non custodial wallet, you remove this risk.

### Considerations

When choosing which type of wallet you want to use, there are a few things you should consider. Here are some questions to answer before making an informed decision. You will find your the answer to almost all of these somewhere on this site.

  1. Can you connect the wallet to your own [node](/node)?
  2. Is the wallet available on your chosen platform?
  3. How easy is the wallet to use?
  4. Does the wallet run over Tor?
  5. Does the wallet support [PSBT](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0174)?
  6. Do you require access to the [Lightning network](/lightning)?
  7. Does the wallet offer [coin control](/privacy/segregate)?
  8. Does the wallet support [coinjoin](/qna/coinjoin)?
  
Regardless of the type of wallet(s) you use, always ensure you have a physical seed [backup](https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/).
