Hardware wallets offers an increase in security when compared with mobile or desktop wallets. They are designed so that your private keys are generated and stored on a dedicated device that is not directly connected to any potentially malware infected device. However, some of these require plugging into a computer to interact with, which exposes them to more risk than their airgapped counterparts. For the ultimate setup in terms of privacy and security, you should look to use an air gapped device in conjunction with a [mobile](/mobile) or [desktop](/desktop) wallet that is connected to your own [node](https://node.guide). 

This type of set-up does come with additional hurdles that may be more difficult to overcome for first timers. This is why there are items in the list below that trade-off some security and privacy to make the user experience smoother by offering a companion app and USB plug in option. Some options in the list offer alt coin support as well as a Bitcoin only firmware option, always ensure you opt for the Bitcoin only version to minimise another attack vector risk.

## Bitbox02

[BitBox02](https://shiftcrypto.shop/en/products/bitbox02-bitcoin-only-edition-pre-order-4/#carousel-example-generic) comes with a touch sensitive interface which,  when combined with the companion desktop app, makes the setup and interaction a breeze for beginners. The BitBox02 has to be plugged into a computer to function and works with its own desktop app (which offers coin control), as well as all popular desktop wallets. Users should ensure they manually write down their seed words upon setup, this is not enforced by the app.

## Seed Signer

[Seed Signer](https://seedsigner.com/) is an offline, air-gapped Bitcoin transaction signing device that can be built from off-the-shelf [components](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner/blob/main/README.md#shopping-list) for around $50. After gathering and assembling the hardware, users flash the open source [software](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner/releases) onto a microSD card, insert to the device and power on. Seed Signer is a 'stateless' device, meaning that once powered off, it does not store any private keys. SeedSigner helps users save with Bitcoin by assisting with trustless private key generation and multi-signature wallet setup, and helps users transact with Bitcoin via a secure, air-gapped QR-exchange signing model.

### Notable Features
* Completely airgapped operation
* Minimises supply chain attack vector
* Can be built for little cost

### Notable Limitations
* Less approachable for beginners
* Less convenient for those transacting more often (due to stateless nature)

## Specter DIY

[Specter DIY](https://specter.solutions/) is an open-source hardware wallet with large touchscreen, QR-code scanner and a smartcard-reader. As the name suggests, this device is built by the user with off the shelf [parts](https://github.com/cryptoadvance/specter-diy/blob/master/docs/shopping.md) that can be purchased from a number of different manufacturers which minimises supply chain risk. Once assembled, the user then flashes the firmware onto the device and proceeds with device setup. The device is supported by Specter Desktop but is still an early project and is not well suited to someone with limited technical knowledge, proceed with caution.
