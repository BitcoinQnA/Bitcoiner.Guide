## Repository for all content found on Bitcoiner.Guide 

I do my best to keep this site current and up to date, but Bitcoin moves pretty fast! Help to ensure the site is as accurate and informative as possible is hugely appreciated! 

You don't need to be a shadowy super coder to help. Here are some ways in which you can get involved:

- Request a guide or topic that you think others might find useful
- Passionate about a certain Bitcoin tool/topic but don't have your own site? I'd be happy to host your writing if it's appropriate
- Translate an article or page into your native language
- Update any info on the site that is no longer accurate
- Fix typos or grammatical errors

### How to get involved

- **Non-technical users** - Create a simple GitHub [issue](https://github.com/BitcoinQnA/Bitcoiner.Guide/issues). *Please provide as much detail as possible about the change or update required*.
- **Technical users** - Fork the project and complete the update via a [Pull Request](https://github.com/BitcoinQnA/Bitcoiner.Guide/pulls). *This is the preferred option as it takes far less of my own resources*.
