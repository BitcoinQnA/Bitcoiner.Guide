| [Hardware Wallet]() |  A dedicated secure device for storing bitcoin private keys in an offline environment |
| [Hash]() | The term given to the action of converting data. Hashing is used by miners to process transactions |

| [SegWit]() |  Segregated Witness is an improvement made in 2017 to increase the network's scalability |
| [Subsidy]() |  The subsidy is paid to the miner that achieves sufficient proof of work for each block. The current subsidy is 6.25 BTC. This halves every 210,000 blocks (roughly 4 years) |
| [Testnet]() |  A separate network with an almost identical design to Bitcoin for developers to test out improvements|
| [Tor]() |  The Onion Router is an alternative network used by users that want to preserve their online privacy |
| [Txid]() |  Transaction Identifier is a unique string of numbers and letters used to label a transaction |
| [UTXO]() | An Unspent Transaction Output is the piece of bitcoin spent to a new address which can be used as an input in future transactions |
