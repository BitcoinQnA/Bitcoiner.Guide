Our mission is simple, to give you short and easy to digest answers to your most frequently asked Bitcoin questions. If you cant find your answer, be sure to [get in touch](/contact). There is a lot of info about Bitcoin out there and it's easy to get bogged down in the thick of it all and become confused. To combat this we keep our answers short and to the point. We suggest that you start at the top of the page and work your way through the sections one at a time.

As with all things tech related, things move quickly but we will endeavour to keep the information here current. With that said, we are human so if you see anything that's incorrect, please reach out to us.
