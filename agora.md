## Introduction
If you are new to Bitcoin, the most common way to acquire it is through a regulated exchange. However, the process involves providing a significant amount of personal information such as your name, address, banking details, and even a scan of your face or voice recording. You will also need to undergo background checks before being approved to make a purchase. 

After all of that, you don't own any Bitcoin yet. You receive an IOU and still need to transfer the funds into a wallet where you control the private keys. This experience is not ideal and goes against the Ethos of Bitcoin. 

Additionally, your personal information is now stored on the exchange's server, making it vulnerable to potential breaches. Unfortunately, such incidents are not uncommon in the Bitcoin world. Companies like 'Mt Gox', 'Binance', and 'Ledger' have all experienced data breaches in the past.

## So what's the alternative?
Buying Bitcoin [noKYConly!](/nokyconly) 

There are many ways to obtain Bitcoin without providing all of your details to a company that may or may not know how to secure data properly. I have guides on using peer-to-peer markets like [Bisq](/bisq), [HodlHodl](/hodlhodl), [Robosats](/robosats) and [Peach Bitcoin](/peach.md) but another noKYC alternative is Agora Desk.

## What is Agora Desk?

Agora Desk is an Open Source and online peer-to-peer platform for trading cryptocurrencies, especially designed to address the issue of KYC in Bitcoin. Agora Desk was created by the same team that developed LocalMonero, which is an equivalent to LocalBitcoins for Monero. 

With a vision to uphold the principles of privacy and freedom, Agora Desk does not require any personal information while offering a wide range of payment methods with good liquidity on the most common. Agora Desk is available on the clearnet, Tor network, and mobile applications on iOS and Android. 

## Before You Start 

### Things you need to know

#### Jargon Buster

|----|-------|
| [Arbitration Bond](https://learn.robosats.com/docs/robots/) | Arbitration bond is a certain amount of Bitcoin that a seller locks in the platform as a guarantee of their credibility and seriousness about a trade. |
| [Trade Escrow](https://learn.robosats.com/docs/robots/) | Escrows are used by the seller as a method of holding the trade amount of Bitcoin. |
| [Advertisements](https://learn.robosats.com/docs/robots/) | Sell offers on Agora Desk. |
| [Dispute Resolution](https://learn.robosats.com/docs/robots/) | Agora Desk provides dispute resolution if there is a disagreement between the buyer and seller. They investigate and make a decision based on evidence provided by both parties. |

### Things you need to have

#### Bitcoin Wallet 

When purchasing non-KYC Bitcoin on Agora, you must provide a receiving Bitcoin address. You can send sats directly to your cold storage or hot wallets such as [Samourai Wallet]() or [Sparrow Wallet]() to start mixing your freshly new acquired sats!

#### Access to Agora Desk

It is time to create your account on Agora Desk. There are several ways you can access Agora desk, some more private than others. Here are all the ways you can access Agora Desk:

- [Via Tor Browser](http://2jopbxfi2mrw6pfpmufm7smacrgniglr7a4raaila3kwlhlumflxfxad.onion/) (Recommended!)
- [Via I2P](http://agoradesk.i2p/) (Recommended!)
- [Via F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.agoradesk.app/)
- [Via the Android APK](https://github.com/AgoraDesk-LocalMonero/agoradesk-app-foss/releases) 
- [Via a regular web-browser](https://agoradesk.com/) (Not recommended!)
- [Via Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agoradesk.app&pli=1) or [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/agoradesk-buy-bitcoin-easily/id1617601678) (Not recommended!)

If you’re new to the Tor browser, learn more and download it [here](https://www.torproject.org/).

#### Create your account

Once you have access to Agora Desk, [sign-up](https://agoradesk.com/signup) for free and create your account. You will be asked for a username, an optional email address* and a password. If you use [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) or [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), it is great practice to generate a random username and password for maximum privacy and security.

**You don't have to enter your email to trade cryptocurrencies, but without it Agora Desk won't be able to recover your password or send you email notifications.*

## Buying Bitcoin

Navigate to the trade page, browse offers, and use filters to narrow your search for the desired amount, currency, seller's country, and payment method. For example, I found GBP offers using Revolut.

<p align="center">

</p>

If none of the payment methods satisfy you, you can create an advertisement with the payment method of your choice and wait for sellers to contact you. However, note that you must have at least 0.001 BTC in your AgoraDesk wallet for a posted BTC call sell ad to be visible. Learn more [here](https://agoradesk.com/nojs/ad/new).

Before taking up an attractive offer, check the "Terms of the Trade" section. Watch out for requests for personal information, like ID photos, under the guise of "security" measures. These offers don't align with the goal of getting non-KYC Bitcoin.

In addition, you have the option to check the reputation of your trading partner by clicking on their username. This will display their feedback score, which is better the higher it is, as well as the feedback left by other users.

## Selling Bitcoin

## FAQ

#### Can I be scammed?
As a buyer, if you've sent the fiat required for your side of the trade, but the seller fails to release the sats to you then you can open a dispute. If during this dispute process you can prove to the Agora Desk arbitrators that you did send the fiat, the sellers escrowed funds and their trade bond will be released to you.
