## Introduction
If you are new to Bitcoin, the most common way to acquire it is through a regulated exchange. However, the process involves providing a significant amount of personal information such as your name, address, banking details, and even a scan of your face or voice recording. You will also need to undergo background checks before being approved to make a purchase. 

After all of that, you don't own any Bitcoin yet. You receive an IOU and still need to transfer the funds into a wallet where you control the private keys. This experience is not ideal and goes against the Ethos of Bitcoin. 

Additionally, your personal information is now stored on the exchange's server, making it vulnerable to potential breaches. Unfortunately, such incidents are not uncommon in the Bitcoin world. Companies like 'Mt Gox', 'Binance', and 'Ledger' have all experienced data breaches in the past.

## So what's the alternative?
Buying Bitcoin [noKYConly!](/nokyconly) 

There are many ways to obtain Bitcoin without providing all of your details to a company that may or may not know how to secure data properly. I have guides on using peer-to-peer markets like [Bisq](/bisq), [HodlHodl](/hodlhodl), [Robosats](/robosats) and [Peach Bitcoin](/peach.md) but another noKYC alternative is Agora Desk.
