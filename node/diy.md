DIY node implementations require you to purchase and build your own hardware, this gives you greater freedom to build to your own budgetary requirements. All implementations below are still designed to run on single board computers (SBC) like the Raspberry Pi, but some offer other options such as the more powerful [RockPro 64](https://www.pine64.org/rockpro64/). DIY nodes remove the hardware risk we discussed in the [Plug + Play](/plug-and-play) page because you are free to buy your hardware from anywhere you like. 

Once you have your chosen hardware you will typically download your chosen project's free and open source software, [flash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew9-J70yxAo) it onto an SD card which then goes into your SBC. To mitigate the risk of installing malicious software onto your device, always download from the project's recommended location and [verify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCG3c8a7HZI) its signature.

## eznode

[eznode](https://ezno.de) is another new node project with a simple setup process.

It is lightweight, minimalistic, supports pruning and can run on your main PC.

<p align="center">
<img src="/assets/img/eznode.png" class=responsive width="420" height="398" maxheight="398">
</p>

### Features

* Simple one-command setup
* Pruning friendly
* Optional trusted [fast-sync](https://ezno.de/packages/#fast-sync) mode
* Personal Electrum Server ([BWT](https://bwt.dev))
* Block Explorer
* Specter Desktop
* Remote access through Tor, SSH tunnels or SSL
* Supports Linux, macOS, Windows and ARMv7/v8

### Ease of setup

eznode can run on a dedicated box (SBCs like Raspberry are supported) or on your main computer/laptop.
It requires <5GB of storage.

You can use any OS you like. The only requirement is to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

To start eznode with a pruned node, a personal Electrum server tracking your `<xpub>` and a block explorer,
run ```docker run -it --rm --name ez -v ~/eznode:/data eznode/eznode XPUB=<xpub>```.
See more instructions [here](https://ezno.de/getting-started).

### Limitations

The most minimalistic of the projects, only supporting a few programs at this time.
No Lightning support (yet).
Doesn't have a web dashboard frontend.
Configuration is done through a config file or CLI arguments (but is rather minimal).

### Cost

Can run on a Raspberry Pi 3 ($40) using an internal SD card ($7 for 16GB) and no additional external storage.

## myNode

The [myNode](https://mynodebtc.com/download) software has downloadable images for the Rock64, RockPro64, Raspberry Pi 4 and also has a [virtual machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIVXjl4SwVo) offering. The free 'Community' software comes with an attractive web based UI and everything you need to get started running a Bitcoin and Lightning node. They do offer a 'Premium' for a one time fee of $99 which enables extra features, a support package and most importantly, one click upgrades from the web UI. Community package users must [upgrade](https://www.reddit.com/r/mynodebtc/collection/5a655fc2-d661-43cb-8097-77d5bb21739d/) from the command line.
