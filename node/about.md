[Bitcoin Node Guide](https://bitcoiner.guide/node) was built to educate Bitcoiners on the importance of running a node. Our aim is to produce an information hub that provides you with enough knowledge to decide which implementation is right for you.

***Your node, your rules.***

We aim to keep this site up to date with the development or additions of new nodes but the Bitcoin industry is a fast moving one, so if you see something incrorrect or missing, please help us out by creating a [pull request](https://github.com/BitcoinQnA).
