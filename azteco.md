## What is Azteco?
Azteco is a service that offers a unique, easy, and private way to purchase Bitcoin. It allows users to buy Bitcoin using a voucher system, like purchasing a prepaid phone card, without sacrificing personal information.

The process is simple - users buy a voucher with a unique code from a participating location or online and then redeem this code on the Azteco website. The equivalent Bitcoin value is transferred directly to the user's wallet upon redemption.

## Preparation

### Bitcoin Wallet 

You need a Bitcoin wallet where you will receive the funds. In this guide, we will leverage a new feature from [Envoy](https://foundationdevices.com/envoy/) called "Azteco Voucher Redemption". This feature lets you scan Azteco's QR code and directly transfer sats to your Passport or Envoy wallet. Otherwise, you need a receiving Bitcoin address from any standard wallet.

If you need a Bitcoin wallet, consider the following options (Avoid Azteco's recommendations):

**On-chain:**
- [Samourai Wallet](https://samouraiwallet.com/)
- [Envoy](https://foundationdevices.com/envoy/)
- [Sparrow Wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) 

**Lightning:**
- [Zeus](https://zeusln.app/) (lightning node required)
- [Phoenix](https://phoenix.acinq.co/)
- [Blixt](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) 

## Buy Vouchers

*Note that Azteco offers lightning and on-chain vouchers. In this guide, we will buy an on-chain voucher.*

### Physical Vendors
The **best** way to acquire your Azteco voucher is through its network of vendors. Check Azteco [official resellers' map](https://azte.co/find_a_vendor) and see if you can trade cash for sats around you. This is the most private way to acquire vouchers as you can pay for cash and by-pass request for identification.

### Order online from Azteco
In some countries, you can also buy online from Azteco and pay by cash, bank transfer, or QR code. Azteco has numerous [cash-in locations](https://azte.co/pay-in-person) in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Costa Rica, South Africa, Ghana, Uganda, Zambia and Ireland. 

Navigate to the [Pay-in-person](https://azte.co/pay-in-person) page where you will find all the necessary instructions to order your voucher online. 

Effectively, you order your voucher online but make the payment in a physical store (or through the local methods of payment, which could be less private or not private at all!). You then receive your voucher by email and redeem it.

### Online resellers
Since Azteco is fairly new, you may not find any vendors around your location. Alternatively, you can buy your voucher online from [approved retailers](https://help.azte.co/article/8-buy-a-voucher-approved-retailers), such as G2A or Kinguin. Note that these online alternatives require you to provide an email address and to use methods of payment that are less private than cash.

Here are some tips you can use to improve your online privacy:
- Use an [email alias](https://simplelogin.io/) to hide your real email address.
- Buy a [Paysafecard](www.paysafecard.com) at your local shop and use it as a payment method.  
- Ask a friend/family member to buy the voucher for you and pay them with cash.
- If online retailers ask for your address, consider using fake address generators such as [Prepostseo](https://www.prepostseo.com/tool/fake-address-generator).

Once you have your voucher and the 16 digits code associated with it, it is time to redeem it. We can do this in two ways: with a receiving address or by scanning a QR code.

## Redeem your Voucher

### Envoy

Download [Envoy](https://foundationdevices.com/envoy/) from the following links and generate a fresh hot wallet if you don't have one. Although the process is straightforward, you can find Envoy's docs [here](https://docs.foundationdevices.com/envoy). Alternatively, if you own a [Passport](https://foundationdevices.com/passport/) (hardware wallet), you can use Envoy to redeem the voucher directly there. 

- [Github](https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/envoy/releases)
- [F-Droid](https://foundationdevices.com/fdroid/)
- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foundationdevices.envoy)
- [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/envoy-by-foundation/id1584811818)

Navigate to [azte.co](https://azte.co/) and enter your 16-digit voucher code. 

Open Envoy, select the account you wish to send sats to and press the scan button. 

Scan the Azteco voucher, confirm the redemption and press continue. Congratulations, you have stacked non-KYC sats!

### Other wallets

If you don't want to use Envoy or purchase a lightning voucher, navigate to [azte.co](https://azte.co/). Enter your 16-digit voucher code and paste your receiving Bitcoin address on the home page. Wait for the transaction to enter the mempool, and voila! 

## FAQ

### What's the market price of Bitcoin when purchasing the voucher? 

When you buy an Azteco voucher, the amount of Bitcoin you will receive is calculated using the market exchange rate at the time of purchase. However, depending on the website, you might have payment fees or commission fees on top of your purchase.

### What are the fees? 

Individual retailers selling Azteco vouchers establish the commission fees. You can view the commission amount on your voucher, and retailers are expected to disclose these costs beforehand. If they don't, feel free to inquire. 

For instance, the approved retailer ENEBA discloses the following: *The bitcoin value of the voucher is calculated using the market price of bitcoin at the time of purchase. Azteco vouchers purchased from **Eneba include a 10% commission fee**. On-chain vouchers also include a "Network fee" to cover the cost of processing your voucher using the Main Bitcoin Network.*

Azteco vouchers might come with an additional "Processing fee" in certain countries. This fee covers the expenses related to processing payments in your local currency. Neither Azteco nor individual retailers determine this fee. 

If you order your voucher from Azteco through the pay-in-person option, you can read the following regarding fees: **7% commission + processing fee applies. Processing fees: Europe & Latin America $1.00 USD - Africa $0.00 USD**

### Can I sell vouchers?
Yes! As a buisness owner you can offer Azteco vouchers to your customers. It opens up a new form of revenue for your business and attracts Bitcoiners in your area. 

You need to open an account with Azteco to become a vendor. This involves signing up and providing certain documents such as proof of residence, ID and selfie.
